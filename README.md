# Cleaning_dirty_documents-kaggle-
This is a kaggle compitation project.

I have used simple 1-layer encoder and decoder with 64-neuron autoencoder.

Its a keras implementation

Error_metric: mean square error

Optimizer: SGD with adam

I have implemented 3 notebooks with 16, 32 and 64 neuron layer.
